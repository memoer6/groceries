// An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
// Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object
// (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next
// middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
// If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass
// control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

// Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the app.use() 
// and app.METHOD() functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware 
// function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase

// This example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed every time the app 
// receives a request.
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})

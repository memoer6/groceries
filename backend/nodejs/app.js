// An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
// Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object
// (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next
// middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
// If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass
// control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
// Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the app.use()


// Returns middleware that only parses json and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches 
// the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation
// of gzip and deflate encodings.
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// This example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed every time the app 
// receives a request.

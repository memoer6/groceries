# The Flask application object has attributes, such as config, that are useful to access within views and CLI
# commands. However, importing the app instance within the modules in your project is prone to circular import
# issues. When using the app factory pattern or writing reusable blueprints or extensions there wonâ€™t be an app
# instance to import at all.
# Flask solves this issue with the application context. Rather than referring to an app directly, you use the
# current_app proxy, which points to the application handling the current activity.
# Lifetime of the context: The application context is created and destroyed as necessary. When a Flask 
# application begins handling a request, it pushes an application context and a request context. When the
# request ends it pops the request context then the application context. Typically, an application context
# will have the same lifetime as a request.
